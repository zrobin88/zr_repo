            <p>Hello, my name is Zack Robin. I'm a 30 year old musician that specializes in guitar and music production. I have been playing guitar for 18 years, play lead guitar for the band Detoura and have my own music production business. I recieved a bachelors degree music production and masters degree in business at Full Sail University. It was at Full Sail that I developed a profound interest in coding which set the stage for my current journey at UCF's coding bootcamp.
